## Difference: Ifrit VS Fuze-Swift?
```diff
+ Fuze-Swift support Pods and Packages :)
- Ifrit supports only Packages :(

- Fuze-Swift is dead :(
+ Ifrit is a Fuse-Swift reborn from hell and ALIVE as ever :)

- Fuze-Swift async/multithreading issues. Crashes is possible :(
+ Ifrit is a Fuze-Swift with fixed multithreading issues - no crashes :)

- Fuze-Swift written for xcode 11 and have a lot of warnings at now :(
+ Ifrit code is updated to swift's latest standards and there are no build warnings :)

- Fuze-Swift supports async functins with callbacks, but does not support async/await
+ Ifrit supports callbacks and async/await both:)

- Fuze-Swift async functions returns incorrect results (wrong indexes) :((((
+ Ifrit's async functins returns correct indexes and covered with tests :)

+ Ifrit - extended coverage with automated tests in general :)
```
