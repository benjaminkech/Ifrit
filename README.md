## What is Ifrit?
Ifrit is fuzzy search library written in pure swift.

Advanteges:
```diff
+ Super lightweight
+ No dependencies
+ Asynchronous search ( async/await + callbacks both )
+ OS supported: MacOS(>=v10_15), iOS(>=v13), VisionOs, Linux
+ Text highlight support (AttributedString)
+ Covered with automated tests
+ Swift 5.9 and higher
+ MIT Licensed
```

Disadvantages:
```diff
- Wasn't tested in production
```

This repository is based on archived repository Fuze-Swift by KRisk ( https://github.com/krisk/fuse-swift)

## Difference: Ifrit VS Fuze-Swift?
```diff
+ Fuze-Swift support Pods and Packages :)
- Ifrit supports only Packages :(

- Fuze-Swift is dead :(
+ Ifrit is a Fuse-Swift reborn from hell and ALIVE as ever :)

- Fuze-Swift async/multithreading issues. Crashes is possible :(
+ Ifrit is a Fuze-Swift with fixed multithreading issues - no crashes :)

- Fuze-Swift written for xcode 11 and have a lot of warnings at now :(
+ Ifrit code is updated to swift's latest standards and there are no build warnings :)

- Fuze-Swift supports async functins with callbacks, but does not support async/await
+ Ifrit supports callbacks and async/await both:)

- Fuze-Swift async functions returns incorrect results (wrong indexes) :((((
+ Ifrit's async functins returns correct indexes and covered with tests :)

+ Ifrit - extended coverage with automated tests in general :)
```

## Usage

#### Searching in a `String`

```swift
let fuse = Fuse()

// SYNC search
let result = fuse.searchSync("od mn war", in: "Old Man's War")

print(result?.score)  // 0.44444444444444442 // LOWEST SCORE = BETTER
print(result?.ranges) // [CountableClosedRange(0...0), CountableClosedRange(2...6), CountableClosedRange(9...12)]

// --------------------
// ASYNC search - async/await

// --------------------
// ASYNC search - callbacks

```

#### Search in `[String]`

```swift
let books = ["The Silmarillion", "The Lock Artist", "The Lost Symbol"]
let fuse = Fuse()

// SYNC search
let results = fuse.searchSync("Te silm", in: books)

results.forEach { item in
    print("index: " + item.index)
    print("score: " + item.score)
    print("ranges: " + item.ranges)
}

// --------------------
// ASYNC search - async/await
let results = await fuse.search("Te silm", in: books)

results.forEach { item in
    print("index: " + item.index)
    print("score: " + item.score)
    print("ranges: " + item.ranges)
}

// --------------------
// ASYNC search - callbacks
fuse.search("Te silm", in: books, completion: { results in
    results.forEach { item in
        print("index: " + item.index)
        print("score: " + item.score)
        print("ranges: " + item.ranges)
    }
})
```

#### Search in `[Fuseable]` objects

```swift
struct Book: Fuseable {
    let title: String
    let author: String
    
    var properties: [FuseProp] {
        return [
            FuseProp(title, weight: 0.3),
            FuseProp(author, weight: 0.7)
        ]
    }
    //Or this like:
    //var properties: [FuseProp] {
    //    return [title, author].map{ FuseProp($0) }
    //}
}

let books: [Book] = [
    Book(author: "John X", title: "Old Man's War fiction"),
    Book(author: "P.D. Mans", title: "Right Ho Jeeves")
]
let fuse = Fuse()

// --------------------
// SYNC version
let results = fuse.searchSync("man", in: books)

results.forEach { item in
    print("index: " + item.index)
    print("score: " + item.score)
    print("results: " + item.results)
    print("---------------")
}

// --------------------
// ASYNC: async/await
let results = await fuse.search("Man", in: books)

results.forEach { item in
    print("index: " + item.index)
    print("score: " + item.score)
    print("results: " + item.results)
    print("---------------")
}

// ASYNC: callbacks
fuse.search("Man", in: books, completion: { results in
    results.forEach { item in
        print("index: " + item.index)
        print("score: " + item.score)
        print("results: " + item.results)
        print("---------------")
    }
})
```

### Options

`Fuse` takes the following options:

- `location`: Approximately where in the text is the pattern expected to be found. Defaults to `0`
- `distance`: Determines how close the match must be to the fuzzy `location` (specified above). An exact letter match which is `distance` characters away from the fuzzy location would score as a complete mismatch. A distance of `0` requires the match be at the exact `location` specified, a `distance` of `1000` would require a perfect match to be within `800` characters of the fuzzy location to be found using a `0.8` threshold. Defaults to `100`
- `threshold`: At what point does the match algorithm give up. A threshold of `0.0` requires a perfect match (of both letters and location), a threshold of `1.0` would match anything. Defaults to `0.6`
- `maxPatternLength`: The maximum valid pattern length. The longer the pattern, the more intensive the search operation will be. If the pattern exceeds the `maxPatternLength`, the `search` operation will return `nil`. Why is this important? [Read this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)#Word_size_choice). Defaults to `32`
- `isCaseSensitive`: Indicates whether comparisons should be case sensitive. Defaults to `false`

## Example Project

!!!!!!!!!!!
Ifrit repository have no example project.
!!!!!!!!!!!

As example project you can use project from original [Fuse-Swift repository](https://github.com/krisk/fuse-swift)
To run the example project:
* clone the Fuse-Swift( https://github.com/krisk/fuse-swift.git ) repo
* and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

1. XCode -> Menu Line -> Add Package Dependencies -> `https://github.com/ukushu/Ifrit.git`

2. `import Ifrit` to your source files.
