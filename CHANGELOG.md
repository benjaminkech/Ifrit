V.2.0

* Fuseable -> Searchable

* Ability to search by exact property instead of standart "Fuseable's'" "properties" property. This will give you ability to implement different search logic for single type of objects. Use case sample: if user search in ukrainian language - it searches title in ukrainian language titles. In case of english - in englishe titles.

* Fixed doctumentation for Fuse from mistakes. Now documentation's code is covered by tests to be sure documentation samples is actual.

* Minor syntax improvements
